    "The paper illustrates and analyze a predictive model that uses Data driven for the energy use of appliances in low energy house. The collected data from various sources are studied to understand the underlying data pattern. In the later part, the data is subjected for filtering process to remove parameters that are irrelevant for the prediction and along with feature ranking. There were four statistical models which was trained with repeated cross-validation and predicted with testing dataset for evaluation purpose: (i)Multiple Linear regression, (ii)Support Vector machine with radial kernel, (iii)Random Forest and (iv)Gradient Boost Machines. Using all the predictors, Gradient Boost Machines was able to attain 0.97 value for variance under training set and 0.57  for testing set. "

By examining the usuage of applicances energy use in a single building might aid a numerous research study on understanding the electrical energy demand ina a particular region. The two important factors that needs contribution for the study are : the type and number of electrical appliances and the usuage of the same by the occupants. Typically, both are interrelated.

It also helped in considering and elimination factors that are needed for the modelling such as socio ecomonic. The past methodologies which was already implemented was also reviewed. The electricity load prediction was examined to identify the parameters, models and other methods that have been useful for energy prediction. The research on electrical energy use patterns in buildings has been an growing area in recent years. Several questions has been explored in various angle to figure out possiblities of shaping the model."

    "The analysis of the dataset in statistical approach generated interesting results from both exploratory analysis and prediction models. Pair plot narrowed our data pattern search with more clear analysis. The RSME and variance of the prediction model such as SVM-radial and multiple linear regression were less compared to GBM and RF models. In the feature selection, humidity and temperature recorded from the wireless sensor network has been proven to increase the prediction accuracy especially data from kitchen, laundry, room, living room and bathrooms. There was difference in importance for certain features like light consumption which proved to have a goood correleation with other features. The future work may incorporate various other features such as solar radiation and precipitation. In addition to it, adding occupancy and occupants acrtivity in each room might give  further more information for the model accuracy."
